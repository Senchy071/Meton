---

## ✅ PHASE 1.5: EXECUTION & SEARCH - COMPLETE

**Goal:** Add code execution and web search capabilities
**Status:** ✅ Complete (4/4 tasks complete)
**Time Taken:** ~3 hours

### Components

- ✅ **Task 9:** Code Execution Tool (subprocess + safety) - COMPLETE
- ✅ **Task 10:** Web Search Tool (DuckDuckGo) - COMPLETE
- ✅ **Task 11:** Update Agent with New Tools - COMPLETE
- ✅ **Task 12:** CLI Commands for Tool Control - COMPLETE

### Bug Fixes (October 30, 2025)

**Critical Bug Fixed: /web on Command Config Persistence**
- **Issue 1**: `/web on` command updated tool's runtime `_enabled` flag but not config object
- **Issue 2**: Changes were not persisted to `config.yaml` file on disk
- **Impact**:
  - Status checks reading from config showed "disabled" even after enabling
  - Agent reading config.yaml file would see old value (disabled)
  - Changes were lost on restart
- **Fix**:
  - Added `save()` method to ConfigLoader class to write config back to YAML
  - Updated `cli.py` `control_web_search()` to:
    1. Update tool runtime flag
    2. Update in-memory config object
    3. Persist to config.yaml file
- **Files Changed**:
  - `core/config.py:164-173` - Added `save()` method
  - `cli.py:288-312` - Updated to call `config.save()`
- **Tests**: All 6 CLI command tests pass (100%)
- **Verification**: Config file now correctly reflects runtime changes

**Library Migration: duckduckgo-search → ddgs**
- **Issue**: `duckduckgo_search` library deprecated and renamed to `ddgs`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `requirements.txt`: `ddgs>=4.0.0` (was `duckduckgo-search>=4.0.0`)
  - Updated imports: `from ddgs import DDGS` (was `from duckduckgo_search import DDGS`)
  - Updated API call: `ddgs.text(query, max_results=N)` (was `ddgs.text(keywords=query, max_results=N)`)
  - Updated error message to reference new package name
- **Files Changed**: `requirements.txt:21`, `tools/web_search.py:192,200-203,236`
- **Tests**: All 8 web search tests pass (100%)

**Environment Issue Fixed: ddgs Not in Virtual Environment**
- **Issue**: `ddgs` library was installed globally but not in project's `venv`
- **Impact**: Agent running via Meton CLI couldn't import ddgs, causing "library not installed" errors
- **Fix**: Installed ddgs in venv: `./venv/bin/pip install ddgs>=4.0.0`
- **Root Cause**: Previous installation used global Python instead of venv
- **Verification**:
  - ✅ `./venv/bin/python3 -c "from ddgs import DDGS"` succeeds
  - ✅ Web search tool works when called via venv Python
  - ✅ Agent can now successfully use web_search tool

**Verification**
- ✅ All 74 tests passing (100% success rate)
- ✅ CLI commands: 6/6 tests pass
- ✅ Web search: 8/8 tests pass
- ✅ Agent integration: 4/4 tests pass
- ✅ Web persistence: All 6 state checks pass
- ✅ Web search now works correctly with real DuckDuckGo queries
- ✅ Config file persistence verified: `/web on` updates all three state locations
  - Runtime tool state (tool._enabled)
  - In-memory config (config.config.tools.web_search.enabled)
  - Config file on disk (config.yaml)

**Features Implemented:**
- 4 specialized agents (Planner, Executor, Reviewer, Synthesizer)
- Task decomposition with dependency handling
- Sequential subtask execution
- Result validation and revision loop
- Result synthesis
- Complex query detection heuristics
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

**Specialized Agents:**
1. **Planner Agent:** Decomposes complex tasks into subtasks with dependencies
2. **Executor Agent:** Executes individual subtasks using available tools
3. **Reviewer Agent:** Validates results for correctness and completeness
4. **Synthesizer Agent:** Combines subtask results into coherent final answer

**Coordination Workflow:**
```
User Query → Planner (decompose)
          → Executor (execute subtasks with dependencies)
          → Reviewer (validate results)
          → [Revisions if needed] → Executor (re-execute)
          → Synthesizer (create final answer)
```

**Complex Query Detection:**
- Explicit requests: "use multi-agent", "multi-agent mode"
- Coordination words: "and then", "after that", "compare", "analyze and"
- Complexity indicators: "comprehensive", "analyze", "research" (2+ occurrences)
- Long queries: >150 characters

**Configuration:**
```yaml
multi_agent:
  enabled: false          # Opt-in feature
  max_subtasks: 10        # Maximum subtasks per task
  max_revisions: 2        # Maximum revision attempts
  parallel_execution: false  # Future: parallel subtask execution
```

**Test Results:**
```
✓ Initialization: 4 agents created successfully
✓ Task Planning: Decomposition with dependencies
✓ Sequential Execution: Respects dependency order
✓ Review & Revision: Approval/rejection workflow
✓ Result Synthesis: Combines all subtask results
✓ Complex Query Detection: All heuristics working
✓ Error Handling: Graceful failure handling
✓ Edge Cases: Single subtask, max limits, empty dependencies
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Total tests: 24
- Passed: 24 (100%)
- Failed: 0

**Key Methods:**
- `coordinate_task(query)` - Main entry point for multi-agent workflow
- `_plan_task(query)` - Decompose task into subtasks
- `_execute_subtasks(subtasks)` - Execute with dependency handling
- `_review_results(results, query)` - Validate results
- `_synthesize_results(results, query)` - Create final answer
- `_handle_revisions(revisions, results)` - Re-execute failed subtasks
- `is_complex_query(query)` - Detect if query needs multi-agent

**Integration Points:**
- Uses `MetonAgent` from `core/agent.py` for each specialized agent
- Shares `ModelManager`, `ConversationManager`, and tools
- Each agent has customized system prompt for its role
- Designed for CLI toggle via `/multiagent on|off` command (future)

### Task 30: Self-Reflection Module - COMPLETE ✅

**Implementation Date:** November 12, 2025
**Files Created:**
- `agent/self_reflection.py` (571 lines) - Self-reflection and response improvement system

- Issue identification system (7 issue types)
- Suggestion generation based on identified issues
- Response improvement using LLM feedback
- Automatic reflection triggering heuristics
- Reflection history tracking and statistics
- Robust JSON parsing from LLM outputs
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks

**Quality Evaluation Criteria:**
1. **Completeness:** Does response address all parts of the query?
2. **Clarity:** Is it well-structured and easy to understand?
3. **Correctness:** Are tool results used properly? Is information accurate?
4. **Conciseness:** Appropriately detailed without unnecessary verbosity?

**Issue Types Detected:**
- `incomplete_answer` - Doesn't fully address query
- `unclear_explanation` - Confusing or poorly structured
- `unused_context` - Ignored relevant tool results
- `too_verbose` - Unnecessarily long
- `missing_code` - Should include code examples
- `no_sources` - Should cite sources
- `incorrect_info` - Factual errors

**Reflection Workflow:**
```
Agent Response → should_reflect() check
              → reflect_on_response() (quality analysis)
              → Quality Score < Threshold OR Critical Issues?
              → Yes: improve_response() (generate better version)
              → Record in history for statistics
```

**Automatic Reflection Triggers:**
- Complex queries: >3 coordination words (and, or, then)
- Analysis queries: starts with analyze, review, compare, evaluate
- Long responses: >500 words
- Multi-tool usage: >2 tools used
- Config-based: auto_reflect_on conditions

**Improvement Criteria:**
- Quality score < threshold (default 0.7)
- Critical issues found (incomplete_answer, incorrect_info)

**Configuration:**
```yaml
reflection:
  enabled: false                    # Opt-in feature

### Task 31: Iterative Improvement Loop - COMPLETE ✅

**Implementation Date:** November 13, 2025
**Files Created:**
- `agent/iterative_improvement.py` (659 lines) - Multi-iteration response refinement system
- `test_iterative_improvement.py` (789 lines) - 22 comprehensive tests

**Features Implemented:**
- Multi-iteration refinement loop with reflection integration
- 5 stop conditions (prioritized): max iterations, quality threshold, convergence, no issues, quality decline
- Convergence detection (improvement < threshold)
- Quality decline detection and reversion
- Improvement tracking with complete iteration history
- Statistics tracking (total sessions, avg iterations, avg improvement, convergence rate)
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Integration with self-reflection module

**Improvement Workflow:**
```
Initial Response → Reflect (iteration 0)
              ↓
Already Excellent (score > threshold)? → Return immediately
              ↓
Iteration Loop:
  1. Check stop conditions
  2. Generate improvement using LLM
  3. Reflect on improved response
  4. Check for quality decline (revert if declined)
  5. Check convergence/threshold
  6. Repeat until satisfied or max iterations
              ↓
Return Final Response + Improvement Path
```

**Stop Conditions (Priority Order):**
1. **Max Iterations:** Hard limit reached (default: 3)
2. **Quality Threshold:** Score ≥ 0.85
3. **Converged:** Recent improvement < 0.05
4. **No Issues:** No problems remaining
5. **Quality Declined:** Current score < previous score (reverts)

**Convergence Detection:**
- Compares most recent improvement (last score - previous score)
- Converged if improvement < convergence_threshold (0.05)
- Example: [0.65, 0.72, 0.74] → improvement = 0.02 < 0.05 → Converged

**Configuration:**
```yaml
iterative_improvement:
  enabled: false                    # Opt-in feature
  max_iterations: 3                 # Maximum iterations allowed
  quality_threshold: 0.85           # Stop if quality reaches this
  convergence_threshold: 0.05       # Stop if improvement < this
  convergence_window: 2             # Scores to compare (unused in final impl)
```

**Test Results:**
```
✓ Already excellent responses (no iteration needed)
✓ Single iteration improvement
✓ Multi-iteration improvement (2-3 iterations)
✓ Max iterations enforcement (stops at limit)
✓ Quality threshold stopping (early stop when excellent)
✓ Convergence detection (plateaued scores)
✓ Should continue logic (all stop conditions)
✓ Quality decline reversion (reverts to previous best)
✓ No issues stopping (no problems left to fix)
✓ Improvement prompt generation
✓ Iteration tracking (complete history)
✓ Statistics calculation (sessions, iterations, improvement, convergence rate)
✓ Sessions distribution by iteration count
✓ Error handling (LLM failures)
✓ Custom configuration values
```

**Statistics Tracked:**
- Total improvement sessions
- Average iterations per session
- Average quality improvement
- Convergence rate (% of sessions that converged naturally)
- Max improvement achieved
- Sessions distribution by iteration count (0, 1, 2, 3+ iterations)

**Example Session:**
```
Query: "Explain async in FastAPI"

Iteration 0: Initial response
  Quality: 0.60
  Issues: [incomplete_answer, missing_code]
  → Continue (score < 0.85, has issues)

Iteration 1: First improvement
  Quality: 0.73
  Issues: [missing_examples]
  → Continue (score < 0.85, has issues)

Iteration 2: Second improvement
  Quality: 0.87
  Issues: []
  → Stop (score ≥ 0.85)

Final: Return iteration 2 response
Total Iterations: 2
Improvement: +0.27
```

**Integration Points:**
- Uses `SelfReflectionModule` for quality analysis at each iteration
- Uses `ModelManager` to get LLM for generating improvements
- Designed for integration with `MetonAgent` in `core/agent.py`
- Stores complete improvement history for analytics
- Supports CLI toggle via `/iterate on|off|stats` command (future)

**Iteration Prompt Template:**
- Includes: iteration number, original query, current response, issues, suggestions, focus areas

### Task 32: Feedback Learning System - COMPLETE ✅

**Implementation Date:** November 13, 2025
**Files Created:**
- `agent/feedback_learning.py` (733 lines) - User feedback learning system with semantic similarity
- `test_feedback_learning.py` (806 lines) - 38 comprehensive tests

**Features Implemented:**
- Feedback recording (positive, negative, correction types)
- Semantic similarity search using sentence embeddings
- Automatic tag extraction from queries and feedback
- Learning insights from feedback patterns
- Feedback persistence with atomic writes
- Export functionality (JSON and CSV formats)
- Statistics and analytics tracking
- Embedding caching for performance
- Fallback word overlap similarity
- Query filtering by type, tag, and ID

**Feedback Types:**
1. **Positive:** User explicitly approves response (marks as helpful)
2. **Negative:** User indicates dissatisfaction (flags as incorrect/unhelpful)
3. **Correction:** User provides corrected version (most valuable for learning)

**Feedback Workflow:**
```
User Response → record_feedback(query, response, type, text, correction)
             → Extract tags automatically
             → Generate UUID
             → Persist to feedback_db.json
             → Cache embedding for similarity search

Similar Query → get_relevant_feedback(query, top_k=5)
             → Encode query to embedding vector
             → FAISS/cosine similarity search
             → Filter by threshold (0.7)
             → Return top-k most relevant feedback

Pattern Analysis → get_learning_insights(query_type, min_occurrences=3)
                → Analyze negative/correction feedback
                → Count pattern occurrences (e.g., "missing examples")
                → Generate actionable insights
                → Return ranked insights by frequency
```

**Semantic Similarity:**
- Uses sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2 (768-dim embeddings)
- Cosine similarity calculation for query matching
- Embedding caching to avoid recomputation
- Fallback to word overlap (Jaccard similarity) if embeddings unavailable
- Similarity threshold filtering (default: 0.7)

**Tag Extraction:**
- Automatic categorization from query/response/feedback text
- 10 tag categories: python, javascript, debugging, refactoring, explanation, examples, documentation, security, performance, testing
- Language tags require explicit language name (prevents false positives)
- Keyword matching for non-language tags
- Sorted alphabetically for consistency

**Learning Insights:**
Pattern-based insight generation from feedback:
- "missing examples" → "Include code examples when explaining concepts"
- "too verbose" → "Users prefer concise responses over verbose explanations"
- "security" keywords → "Emphasize security implications in code reviews"
- "incomplete" → "Ensure responses fully address all parts of the query"
- "unclear" → "Improve clarity and structure of explanations"

**Configuration:**
```yaml
feedback_learning:
  enabled: true                      # Always collect feedback
  use_for_improvement: false         # Apply learnings to prompts (opt-in)
  similarity_threshold: 0.7          # Min similarity for relevant feedback
  max_relevant_feedback: 5           # Max results to return
  storage_path: ./feedback_data      # Storage directory
```

**Test Results:**
```
✓ Record positive/negative/correction feedback
✓ Invalid feedback type error handling
✓ Feedback persistence (save/load)
✓ Multiple records persistence
✓ Tag extraction (single and multiple topics)
✓ Feedback summary (empty and populated)
✓ Common tags in summary
✓ Recent feedback count (last 7 days)
✓ Learning insights (no feedback, missing examples, verbosity, security)
✓ Insights filtered by query type
✓ Relevant feedback retrieval (empty, similarity, threshold, top-k)
✓ Export (JSON, CSV, empty CSV, custom path)
✓ Invalid export format error
✓ Clear feedback
✓ Get feedback by ID (found and not found)
✓ Get feedback by type
✓ Get feedback by tag
✓ Word overlap similarity (with and without overlap)
✓ UUID uniqueness
✓ FeedbackRecord to_dict/from_dict conversion
✓ Corrupt database recovery
✓ Atomic write protection
```

**Statistics Tracked:**
- Total feedback count
- Positive/negative/correction counts and ratios
- Common tags (top 10)
- Recent feedback (last 7 days)
- Pattern frequencies for insights

**Storage Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid-here",
    "timestamp": "2025-11-13T10:00:00",
    "query": "Explain async/await",
    "response": "...",
    "feedback_type": "negative",
    "feedback_text": "Missing examples",
    "correction": null,
    "context": {"tools_used": ["web_search"], "reflection_score": 0.65},
    "tags": ["python", "examples", "explanation"]
  }
]
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
# Record feedback
feedback_id = system.record_feedback(
    query="Explain async/await in Python",
    response="...",
    feedback_type="negative",
    feedback_text="Missing practical examples",
    context={"tools_used": [], "reflection_score": 0.65}
)

# Find relevant feedback for similar queries
relevant = system.get_relevant_feedback(
    "How does Python handle concurrency?",
    top_k=5,
    similarity_threshold=0.7
)

# Get learning insights
insights = system.get_learning_insights("python", min_occurrences=3)
# → ["Include code examples when explaining concepts"]

# Export feedback
export_path = system.export_feedback(format="csv")
```

**Integration Points:**
- Uses same embedding model as RAG system (sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2)
- Designed for integration with `MetonAgent` to provide context from past feedback
- Supports CLI commands via `/feedback` (future implementation)
- Feedback can inform agent prompts when `use_for_improvement: true`
- Thread-safe atomic writes prevent data corruption
- Local storage only (privacy-preserving)

**Future CLI Commands (Design):**
```
/feedback positive "Great explanation!"
/feedback negative "Missing examples"
/feedback correct "Actually, it should be X"
/feedback stats     # Show statistics
/feedback insights  # Show learning insights
/feedback export    # Export feedback data
```

- Parallel execution of independent tools using ThreadPoolExecutor
- Sequential execution of dependent tools in correct order
- Timeout handling per tool (configurable)
- Error recovery with partial results
- Performance statistics and speedup tracking
- Thread-safe execution with locks
- Fallback to sequential execution on errors
- Configurable max parallel workers

**Parallel Execution Workflow:**
```
Tool Calls → Analyze Dependencies
          ↓
Independent Tools:  [web_search, codebase_search]
Dependent Tools:    [file_write → code_executor]
          ↓
Execute Independent in Parallel (ThreadPoolExecutor)
Execute Dependent Sequentially
          ↓
Collect All Results (success or error)
Calculate Speedup Statistics
Return Combined Results
```

**Dependency Detection Rules:**

**Always Independent (can parallelize):**
- Multiple web_search calls
- Multiple codebase_search calls
- web_search + codebase_search
- file_operations (read) + web_search
- file_operations (read) + codebase_search

**Dependent (must sequence):**
- file_operations (write) → code_executor (on same file)
- file_operations (write) → file_operations (read same file)
- Any tool → tool consuming its results
- code_executor depends on file writes

**Conservative Default:**
- Unknown tool pairs are treated as dependent (safe default)
- Prevents race conditions and data corruption

**ThreadPoolExecutor:**
- Configurable max_workers (default: 3 parallel tools)
- Per-tool timeout (default: 30 seconds)
- Future-based execution with result collection
- Graceful timeout handling (returns error dict)
- Thread-safe statistics collection

**Speedup Measurement:**
```
Sequential Time = sum(all tool execution times)
Parallel Time = max(parallel group times) + sum(sequential times)
Speedup = Sequential Time / Parallel Time

Example:
- web_search: 2.0s
- codebase_search: 1.5s
Sequential: 3.5s total
Parallel: max(2.0, 1.5) = 2.0s
Speedup: 3.5 / 2.0 = 1.75x
```

**Configuration:**
```yaml
parallel_execution:
  enabled: false                    # Opt-in feature
  max_parallel_tools: 3             # Thread pool size
  timeout_per_tool: 30              # Timeout per tool (seconds)
  fallback_to_sequential: true      # Fallback on parallel failure
```

**Test Results:**
```
✓ Execute single tool (no parallelization needed)
✓ Execute 2 independent tools in parallel
✓ Execute 3 independent tools in parallel
✓ Dependency detection (independent tools)
✓ Dependency detection (dependent tools)
✓ Is independent - multiple web searches
✓ Is independent - multiple codebase searches
✓ Is independent - web_search + codebase_search
✓ Is dependent - file write + code executor
✓ Timeout handling (tool exceeds limit)
✓ Error handling - tool failure
✓ Error handling - partial results (one tool fails)
✓ Statistics tracking
✓ Speedup measurement
✓ Empty tool calls handling
✓ Tool not found error
✓ Mixed execution (some parallel, some sequential)
✓ Reset statistics
✓ Fallback to sequential execution
✓ Thread safety (concurrent executions)
✓ ExecutionRecord dataclass
✓ Sequential execution preserves order
✓ Config max_workers enforcement
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Total tests: 23
- Passed: 23 (100%)
- Failed: 0

**Key Methods:**
- `execute_parallel(tool_calls)` - Main entry point, analyzes dependencies and executes
- `_analyze_dependencies(tool_calls)` - Detect which tools can run concurrently
- `_is_independent(tool1, tool2)` - Check if two tools are independent
- `_execute_independent_batch(tool_calls)` - Execute independent tools in parallel
- `_execute_sequential(tool_calls)` - Execute dependent tools in order
- `_execute_single_tool(tool_name, args, timeout)` - Execute one tool with timeout
- `get_execution_stats()` - Return statistics (executions, speedup, times, errors)
- `reset_stats()` - Clear all statistics
- `shutdown()` - Shutdown thread pool executor

**Data Structures:**
- **ExecutionRecord:** Single execution record (tool_calls, sequential_time, parallel_time, speedup, independent_count, dependent_count, timeout_count, error_count)

**Statistics Tracked:**
- Total parallel executions
- Average speedup (parallel vs sequential)
- Tool execution times (average per tool)
- Timeout count
- Error count
- Total independent tool executions
- Total dependent tool executions

**Example Usage:**
```python
# Create executor
executor = ParallelToolExecutor(tools, config)

# Execute multiple tools
tool_calls = [
    {"tool": "web_search", "args": {"query": "Python async"}},
    {"tool": "codebase_search", "args": {"query": "authentication"}},
    {"tool": "web_search", "args": {"query": "FastAPI tutorial"}}
]

# All 3 execute concurrently (~3x speedup)
results = executor.execute_parallel(tool_calls)

# Check statistics
stats = executor.get_execution_stats()
print(f"Average speedup: {stats['average_speedup']:.2f}x")
```

**Error Handling:**
```python
# One tool fails
results = {
    "web_search": {"results": [...]},
    "codebase_search": {"error": "Timeout after 30s", "tool": "codebase_search"},
    "file_operations": {"content": "..."}
}

# Agent continues with partial results
# Failed tools return error dict instead of raising exception
```

**Integration Points:**
- Uses ThreadPoolExecutor from concurrent.futures
- Designed for integration with `MetonAgent` in `core/agent.py`
- Supports CLI toggle via `/parallel on|off|stats` command (future)
- Tool results collected atomically with thread-safe locks
- Compatible with all existing tools (file_ops, web_search, code_executor, codebase_search)
- No shared state modification during parallel execution

**Thread Safety:**
- All statistics updates protected by threading.Lock
- Tool execution is isolated (no shared state)
- Results collected atomically
- Future-based execution prevents race conditions
- Test validation with concurrent executor calls

**Performance Benefits:**
- Up to Nx speedup for N independent tools (network/IO bound)
- Reduced total query time for multi-tool queries
- Automatic optimization with no code changes required
- Conservative dependency detection prevents data corruption
- Statistics tracking for performance monitoring

**Future CLI Commands (Design):**
```
/parallel on       # Enable parallel execution
/parallel off      # Disable parallel execution
/parallel stats    # Show execution statistics and speedups
/parallel status   # Show current configuration
```

**Documentation:** [CONVERSATION_MANAGER.md](CONVERSATION_MANAGER.md)

---

### Phase 3: Agent System (Complete)

**Files Created/Enhanced:**
- `core/agent.py` (676 lines) - LangGraph ReAct Agent implementation
- `test_agent.py` (400+ lines) - 8 comprehensive tests

**Test Results:**
```
✅ 7 out of 8 Agent tests passed!

✓ Initialization: PASSED
✓ Query With Tool: PASSED
✓ Multi Step Reasoning: PASSED
✓ Query Without Tool: PASSED
✓ Iteration Limit: PASSED
✓ Error Handling: PASSED
✗ Conversation Context: FAILED (edge case - LLM consistency issue)
✓ Tool Management: PASSED
```

**Key Features:**
- LangGraph StateGraph architecture for ReAct pattern
- Three-node workflow: reasoning → tool_execution → observation
- Multi-step Think → Act → Observe loop
- Structured agent output parsing (THOUGHT, ACTION, ACTION_INPUT, ANSWER)
- Tool integration via tool_map dictionary
- Verbose mode for debugging agent's thought process
- Iteration limits (configurable max_iterations)
- Recursion limit handling for LangGraph
- Conversation context integration
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Tool management (add/remove tools dynamically)
- Custom exceptions (AgentError, AgentExecutionError, AgentParsingError)
- Detailed system prompt with ReAct instructions
- State context building from previous thoughts and tool calls

**Critical Implementation Details:**
- Fixed agent looping issue by explicitly showing recent tool results in prompt
- Set recursion_limit = max_iterations * 3 (3 nodes per iteration)
- Agent sees tool output in next reasoning step for proper decision making
- Conditional edges for tool execution and continuation decisions
- **Loop Detection System** (October 2025):
  - Detects when agent tries to call same tool with same input twice
  - Automatically forces answer using existing tool result
  - Prevents infinite loops caused by LLM not following ANSWER format
  - Provides warning to LLM when repeated calls detected

**Path Context Injection:**
- System prompt dynamically injects current working directory
- Shows allowed paths from config to prevent invalid path attempts
- Provides concrete examples using real paths (not placeholders)
- Clear visual sections using Unicode box drawing characters

**Known Limitations:**
- Conversation context test fails due to LLM consistency (not following ANSWER format reliably)
- This is expected behavior with ReAct agents - loop detection mitigates the issue
- LLM sometimes tries to repeat tool calls instead of providing ANSWER
- Loop detection catches this and forces completion
- **Multi-step queries involving large files (>30KB) may timeout or be slow**
  - Root cause: ReAct pattern passes full file contents through each reasoning iteration
  - Large contexts (700+ line files) slow down local model inference significantly
  - **Workaround**: Ask questions separately or use more specific queries (e.g., "search for X in file" instead of "read file and find X")
  - **Proper fix**: Phase 6+ RAG implementation with FAISS - retrieve only relevant chunks instead of loading full files

**Documentation:** [AGENT.md](AGENT.md)

### Task 11: Update Agent with New Tools (Complete)

**Files Modified:**
- `core/agent.py` - Updated system prompt with tool usage examples and selection rules
- `cli.py` - Registered code_executor and web_search tools with agent
- `test_agent_integration.py` (219 lines) - Integration test suite with 4 tests

**Test Results:**
```
✅ All Agent Integration tests passed! (4/4)

✓ Agent Initialization: PASSED (all 3 tools registered)
✓ Code Execution via Agent: PASSED (agent used code_executor correctly)
✓ Web Search Disabled: PASSED (agent handled disabled tool properly)
✓ File Operations: PASSED (existing tool still works correctly)
```

**Key Changes:**

1. **System Prompt Updates:**
   - Added Example 7: Code execution workflow
   - Added Example 8: Web search when disabled (default state)
   - Added Example 9: Web search when enabled
   - Added Tool Selection Rules section with guidance on when to use each tool

2. **Tool Selection Rules Added:**
   ```
   Use code_executor when:
   - User asks to run/test/execute Python code
   - User wants to debug code snippets
   - User asks "what does this code output"

   Use web_search when:
   - User explicitly asks to "search" for something online
   - User wants to find information on the web
   - NOTE: Web search is DISABLED by default

   Use file_operations when:
   - User asks to read/write/list/create files
   - User wants to see file contents
   - User asks about files in the project
   ```

3. **CLI Integration:**
   - Imported CodeExecutorTool and WebSearchTool
   - Created instances of both tools during initialization
   - Registered tools with agent: `[file_tool, code_tool, web_tool]`

**Agent Behavior Examples:**

Example 1 - Code Execution:
```
User: "Run this code: print('hello world')"

Agent workflow:
1. THOUGHT: User wants to run Python code
2. ACTION: code_executor
3. INPUT: {"code": "print('hello world')"}
4. [Tool returns: {"success": true, "output": "hello world"}]
5. ANSWER: The code executes successfully and outputs 'hello world'
```

Example 2 - Web Search (Disabled):
```
User: "Search for Python tutorials"

Agent workflow:
1. THOUGHT: User wants to search the web
2. ACTION: web_search
3. INPUT: {"query": "Python tutorials"}
4. [Tool returns: {"success": false, "error": "Web search is disabled..."}]
5. ANSWER: Web search is currently disabled. Enable it with /web on command.
```

Example 3 - File Operations (Still Works):
```
User: "List files in the current directory"

Agent workflow:
1. THOUGHT: User wants to list files
2. ACTION: file_operations
3. INPUT: {"action": "list", "path": "/current/directory"}
4. [Tool returns file list]
5. ANSWER: [Lists files found]
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Agent recognizes all 3 tools
- ✅ Agent selects correct tool based on user query
- ✅ Agent handles disabled tools gracefully
- ✅ Agent follows ReAct pattern with new tools
- ✅ Existing file_operations functionality intact

**Status:** Agent fully integrated with new tools ✅

   - `show_web_status()` - Display current web search state
   - `control_web_search(action)` - Enable/disable based on action
   - Supports aliases: on/enable, off/disable, status

3. **Tools Display Enhancement:**
   - Added "Status" column to tools table
   - Shows ✅ enabled or ❌ disabled for each tool
   - Checks `is_enabled()` method if available

**Usage Examples:**

```bash
# Check web search status
/web
# Output: Web search: disabled

# Enable web search
/web on
# Output: ✅ Web search enabled

# Now user can search
You: "Search for Python tutorials"
# Agent will actually perform web search

# Disable web search
/web off
# Output: ✅ Web search disabled

# Try to search again
You: "Search for Python tutorials"
# Agent: "Web search is currently disabled. Enable with /web on command."

# View all tools with status
/tools
# Shows table with status column
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ /web command with all variations works
- ✅ /tools shows correct status for all tools
- ✅ /help includes web control commands
- ✅ Web search can be toggled at runtime
- ✅ Agent respects web search enable/disable state

**Status:** CLI commands fully functional ✅

# Minimum score: 0, Maximum score: 100
```

**Output Format:**
```python
{
    "success": bool,
    "issues": [ReviewIssue, ...],  # List of issue dictionaries
    "summary": {
        "total_issues": int,
        "by_severity": {"CRITICAL": int, "HIGH": int, ...},
        "by_category": {"security": int, "best_practices": int, ...}
    },
    "score": int  # 0-100
}
```

**Example Usage:**

**Security Review:**
```python
from skills.code_reviewer import CodeReviewerSkill

skill = CodeReviewerSkill()

code = """
def login(username, password):
    api_key = "hardcoded_secret_123"
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + username + "'"
    return eval(query)
"""

result = skill.execute({
    "code": code,
    "checks": ["security"]
})

# Result:
# - CRITICAL: eval() usage
# - HIGH: SQL injection pattern
# - HIGH: Hardcoded secret 'api_key'
# Score: ~50 (100 - 20 - 10 - 10)
```

**Selective Checks:**
```python
# Run only specific checks
result = skill.execute({
    "code": code,
    "checks": ["security"]  # Only security checks
})

result = skill.execute({
    "code": code,
    "checks": ["style", "best_practices"]  # Multiple categories
})
```

**All Checks:**

### Task 28: Skill Manager (Complete)

**Files Created/Enhanced:**
- `skills/skill_manager.py` (370 lines) - Dynamic skill loading and management system
- `test_skill_manager.py` (610 lines) - Complete test suite with 25 tests

**Test Results:**
```
✅ All Skill Manager tests passed! (25/25)

Test Categories:
✓ Initialization & Discovery: 2/2 PASSED
✓ Load/Unload Operations: 5/5 PASSED
✓ List & Query Operations: 6/6 PASSED
✓ Bulk Operations: 2/2 PASSED
✓ Advanced Features: 6/6 PASSED
✓ Integration Tests: 4/4 PASSED
```

**Key Features:**

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Dynamic Loading:** Load skills at runtime without restarting
- **Discovery:** Automatically discover skills in skills directory
- **Management:** Load, unload, reload individual or all skills
- **Querying:** Check loaded status, get skill instances, retrieve info

**Main Methods:**
```python
# Discovery
_discover_skills() -> None           # Scan for available skills

# Loading/Unloading
load_skill(name: str) -> bool        # Load single skill
unload_skill(name: str) -> bool      # Unload single skill
reload_skill(name: str) -> bool      # Reload skill (unload + load)

# Bulk Operations
load_all_skills() -> int             # Load all available skills
unload_all_skills() -> int           # Unload all loaded skills

# Querying
list_loaded_skills() -> List[str]    # List loaded skill names
list_available_skills() -> List[str] # List discoverable skills
get_skill(name: str) -> Optional[BaseSkill]  # Get skill instance
is_loaded(name: str) -> bool         # Check if skill is loaded
is_available(name: str) -> bool      # Check if skill exists

# Information
get_skill_info(name: str) -> Optional[Dict]  # Get skill metadata
get_loaded_count() -> int                    # Count loaded skills
get_available_count() -> int                 # Count available skills
rediscover_skills() -> int                   # Rescan directory
```

**Dynamic Import Implementation:**
```python
# Uses importlib for dynamic module loading
import importlib.util

spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(skill_name, file_path)
module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
spec.loader.exec_module(module)

# Find BaseSkill subclass and instantiate
for item_name in dir(module):
    item = getattr(module, item_name)
    if issubclass(item, BaseSkill) and item is not BaseSkill:
        skill_instance = item()
        break
```

**Discovery Process:**
- Scans `skills/` directory for `.py` files
- Excludes: `__init__.py`, `base.py`, `skill_manager.py`
- Maps skill names to file paths
- Automatic discovery on initialization

**Example Usage:**

**Basic Operations:**
```python
from skills.skill_manager import SkillManager

# Initialize manager (auto-discovers skills)
manager = SkillManager()

# Load a skill
success = manager.load_skill("code_explainer")
if success:
    # Get and use the skill
    skill = manager.get_skill("code_explainer")
    result = skill.execute({"code": "def add(a, b): return a + b"})
    print(result["summary"])

# Unload when done
manager.unload_skill("code_explainer")
```

**Bulk Operations:**
```python
# Load all available skills at once
count = manager.load_all_skills()
print(f"Loaded {count} skills")

# List what's loaded
loaded = manager.list_loaded_skills()
print(f"Loaded: {', '.join(loaded)}")

# Unload everything
manager.unload_all_skills()
```

**Reload for Development:**
```python
# After modifying a skill file
manager.reload_skill("code_explainer")  # Unload + Load
```

**Querying:**
```python
# Check status
if manager.is_available("code_explainer"):
    if not manager.is_loaded("code_explainer"):
        manager.load_skill("code_explainer")

# Get information
info = manager.get_skill_info("code_explainer")
print(f"{info['name']} v{info['version']}: {info['description']}")

# Count skills
print(f"{manager.get_loaded_count()}/{manager.get_available_count()} loaded")
```

**CLI Integration (Documented):**
```python
# Proposed /skills command
/skills list              # Show loaded and available skills
/skills load <name>       # Load a skill
/skills unload <name>     # Unload a skill
/skills reload <name>     # Reload a skill
/skills load-all          # Load all skills
/skills unload-all        # Unload all skills
```

**Config Support (Proposed):**
```yaml
skills:
  enabled: true
  auto_load: true               # Load all on startup
  auto_load_list: []            # Specific skills to load (empty = all)
```

**Integration Points:**
- Can be added to `MetonAgent` for runtime skill access
- Skills can be loaded/unloaded without restarting application
- Useful for development (reload after changes)
- Useful for resource management (load only needed skills)

**Advanced Capabilities:**
- Thread-safe operations (uses standard Python imports)
- Graceful error handling (returns False on failure, logs errors)
- Skill independence (each load creates new instance)
- Multiple load/unload cycles supported
- Skill execution after loading works correctly
- Rediscovery for hot-reloading new skill files

**Error Handling:**
- Invalid skill names: Returns False, logs warning
- Already loaded: Returns True (idempotent)
- Import errors: Returns False, logs error
- Missing BaseSkill subclass: Returns False, logs error
- File not found: Detected during discovery

**Use Cases:**
1. **Development:** Reload skills after code changes
2. **Resource Management:** Load only needed skills to save memory
3. **Dynamic Configuration:** Enable/disable features at runtime
4. **Testing:** Load/unload skills for isolated testing
5. **Plugin System:** Treat skills as plugins that can be added/removed

**Integration Status:**
- ✅ Inherits from standard Python patterns
- ✅ Compatible with all existing skills
- ✅ Enable/disable per-skill functionality preserved
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Full test coverage (25 tests, 100% pass rate)

**Status:** Skill Manager complete and tested ✅

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Type Detection Matters**: The Ollama library uses custom types (`ListResponse`) rather than plain dicts - always inspect library response types
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Writing comprehensive tests caught critical bugs immediately
3. **Documentation As You Go**: Creating documentation during development (not after) results in better quality
4. **Iterator Pattern for Streaming**: Python's iterator pattern works perfectly for LLM streaming responses
5. **Thread Safety from the Start**: Adding `threading.Lock` early ensures safe concurrent access for future features
6. **Auto-Save Trade-offs**: Auto-save adds convenience but has I/O overhead - made it configurable
7. **Context Window Management**: Preserving system messages while trimming conversation history requires careful algorithm design
8. **LangGraph State Management**: Explicit state passing between nodes provides clear reasoning traces
9. **Prompt Engineering for Agents**: LLMs need explicit instructions to follow structured output formats (THOUGHT/ACTION/ANSWER)
10. **Recursion Limits**: LangGraph requires setting recursion_limit high enough for multi-step reasoning (iterations × nodes)
11. **Pydantic Restrictions**: Runtime attributes need `object.__setattr__()` to bypass Pydantic validation
12. **Security First**: Path validation and sandboxing are critical for file operation tools
13. **AST Validation**: Python's AST module is powerful for static code analysis before execution - prevents entire classes of security issues
14. **Subprocess Isolation**: Running untrusted code in subprocess provides true isolation - separate memory space, easy timeout/kill
15. **Disabled by Default**: Web-facing tools (search, network access) should be disabled by default and require explicit user opt-in for security
16. **API-Free Solutions**: DuckDuckGo search works without API keys, simplifying deployment and avoiding rate limits
17. **Runtime Tool Control**: Storing tool references in CLI allows dynamic enable/disable without restart - important for security-sensitive tools
